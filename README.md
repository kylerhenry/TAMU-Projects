# TAMU-Projects
A collection of my work over the years as a student at TAMU

All of these projects except the following were intended to be run in a 64-bit linux environment:
-Doubly-Linked Lists PA -> run in VS or make exe
-Heightmaps -> run in VS or make exe
-Stacks PA -> run in VS or make exe

This repository will continue to updated as more projects are completed.
